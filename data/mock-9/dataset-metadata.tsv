human-readable-description	A mock community composed of 16 fungal strains represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples.  These are the same community members present in mock-10, which is the same mock community samples analyzed on a separate Illumina HiSeq run. This was generated by Dr. Benjamin Wolfe at Harvard University, in 2012.
