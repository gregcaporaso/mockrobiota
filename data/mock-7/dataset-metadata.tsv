human-readable-description	A mock community composed of 67 bacteria represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples. These are the same community members present in mock-8, which consists of the same mock community samples analyzed on different Illumina sequencing runs. This was generated by Dr. Peter Turnbaugh at Harvard in 2012.
