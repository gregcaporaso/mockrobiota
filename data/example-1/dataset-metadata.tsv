name	value
citation	hyperlink to original citation or pubmed listing (recommended), or optionally full citation details (not recommended). If not published, NA.
qiita-id	Study ID if raw data are deposited in qiita. If not, list NA
raw-data-url	http://www.qiime.org
human-readable-description	Describe this dataset in as much detail as possible. Who generated these data, where, and when? How many strains and species are included in the mock community? How many samples? Were species mixed at equal ratios or uneven ratios? More is always better
bokulich2013-id	NA. This field is only used for the original 11 datasets in mockrobiota, and lists the dataset ID listed in doi:10.1038/nmeth.2276. All new datasets should list NA for this field.
bokulich2015-id	NA. This field is only used for the original 11 datasets in mockrobiota, and lists the dataset ID listed in https://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.934v2. All new datasets should list NA for this field.
target-gene	For marker-gene studies, what gene was amplified? For example, 16S, ITS, or 18S. For other study types, list NA
target-subfragment	For marker-gene studies, what gene domain was amplified? For example, V4 or ITS1
study-type	marker-gene or metagenome (other study types may be accepted. If you already have published mock community data of another type and would like to contribute these data to mockrobiota, create an issue using the link above to propose new study types.
sequencing-instrument	What sequencing technology/instrument was used? For example, illumina-miseq
physical-specimen-available	Yes or No. Are physical aliquots of this mock community available to share with other researchers?
contact-email	email address of person to contact with questions about this dataset.
