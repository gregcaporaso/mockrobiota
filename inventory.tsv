mock-10	https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data/mock-10/	ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/illumina-mock-communities-raw-data/ITS_SAG/	1975	marker-gene	ITS	A mock community composed of 16 fungal strains represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples.  These are the same community members present in mock-9, which is the same mock community samples analyzed on a separate Illumina HiSeq run. This was generated by Dr. Benjamin Wolfe at Harvard University, in 2012.
mock-11	https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data/mock-11/	ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/illumina-mock-communities-raw-data/L18S-1/	1517	marker-gene	18S	A mock community composed of 11 fungal strains plus human DNA, represented in equal abundances in a single sample. This was generated by the Broad Institute in 2011, and the sequencing data was contributed by Dr. Laura Parfrey at University of Colorado, Boulder, in 2012.
mock-1	https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data/mock-1/	ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/illumina-mock-communities-raw-data/S16S-1/	1687	marker-gene	16S	A mock community composed of 48 bacteria represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples. These are the same community members present in mock-2, which consists of the same mock community samples analyzed on a separate Illumina MiSeq run. This was generated by Dr. Sathish Subramanian at Washington University, St. Louis, in 2012.
mock-2	https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data/mock-2/	ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/illumina-mock-communities-raw-data/S16S-2/	1688	marker-gene	16S	A mock community composed of 48 bacteria represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples. These are the same community members present in mock-1, which consists of the same mock community samples analyzed on a separate Illumina HiSeq run. This was generated by Dr. Sathish Subramanian at Washington University, St. Louis, in 2012.
mock-3	https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data/mock-3/	ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/illumina-mock-communities-raw-data/Broad1/	1685	marker-gene	16S	A mock community composed of 22 bacterial strains represented in equal abundances in two replicate samples, and the same strains represented in uneven abundances in two replicate samples. These are the same community members present in mock-4 and mock-5, which consists of the same mock community samples analyzed on separate Illumina sequencing runs. This was generated by Dr. Dirk Gevers at Broad Institute in 2012.
mock-4	https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data/mock-4/	ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/illumina-mock-communities-raw-data/Broad2/	1686	marker-gene	16S	A mock community composed of 22 bacterial strains represented in equal abundances in two replicate samples, and the same strains represented in uneven abundances in two replicate samples. These are the same community members present in mock-3 and mock-5, which consists of the same mock community samples analyzed on separate Illumina sequencing runs. This was generated by Dr. Dirk Gevers at Broad Institute in 2012.
mock-5	https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data/mock-5/	ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/illumina-mock-communities-raw-data/Broad3/	1972	marker-gene	16S	A mock community composed of 22 bacterial strains represented in equal abundances in two replicate samples, and the same strains represented in uneven abundances in two replicate samples. These are the same community members present in mock-3 and mock-4, which consist of the same mock community samples analyzed on separate Illumina sequencing runs. This was generated by Dr. Dirk Gevers at Broad Institute in 2012.
mock-6	https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data/mock-6/	ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/illumina-mock-communities-raw-data/Turnbaugh1/	721+722	marker-gene	16S	A mock community composed of 67 bacteria represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples. These are the same community members present in mock-7 and mock-8, which consist of the same mock community samples analyzed on different Illumina sequencing runs. The mock community samples were generated by Dr. Peter Turnbaugh at Harvard in 2010, and sequenced by Illumina, Inc. in San Diego, CA, in 2010.
mock-7	https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data/mock-7/	ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/illumina-mock-communities-raw-data/Turnbaugh3/	NA	marker-gene	16S	A mock community composed of 67 bacteria represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples. These are the same community members present in mock-8, which consists of the same mock community samples analyzed on different Illumina sequencing runs. This was generated by Dr. Peter Turnbaugh at Harvard in 2012.
mock-8	https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/tree/master/data/mock-8/	ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/illumina-mock-communities-raw-data/Turnbaugh2/	1973	marker-gene	16S	A mock community composed of 67 bacteria represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples.
